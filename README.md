# 🍽️ Food Delivery Management System

A comprehensive **Food Delivery Management System** developed as an academic **DBMS mini-project**. The system efficiently handles food orders, payments, memberships, and delivery management, simulating a real-world food delivery service using a modular design. The backend is powered by **Oracle SQL Plus**, and the application is built using **Java (NetBeans IDE)** and **Swing GUI** components.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

To design a **Food Delivery Management System** and analyze the data, identifying:
- Constraints among attributes
- Dependencies among attributes
- Efficient organization and management of structured data using SQL-based relational database design

---

## 📖 Extended Exploration

The **Food Delivery Management System (FDMS)** is a comprehensive framework designed to:
- Manage customers, restaurants, drivers, and orders
- Integrate various modules with relational constraints
- Ensure smooth order processing and delivery flow
- Enforce data integrity using SQL constraints and relationships

This system includes:
- Structured schema with primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints
- Role-based modules for customer, restaurant, and delivery driver
- GUI application for login, placing orders, and managing data

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Java Swing (`javax.swing`)
- **Backend**: Java JDBC (`java.sql`)
- **Database**: Oracle SQL Plus
- **IDE Used**: NetBeans

## 🗃️ Database Schema Overview

### 🔹 `ORDERS`
- Fields: `Oid`, `Cid`, `Rid`, `Did`, `status`, `order_date_time`, `del_date_time`, `Orating`, `price`
- Constraints:
  - `Oid` starts with 'O'
  - Valid order statuses and ratings
  - Delivery time must be after order time

### 🔹 `ORDER_DETAILS`
- Fields: `Oid`, `Iid`, `price`, `Qty`
- Primary Key: (`Oid`, `Iid`)
- Constraints:
  - Positive price and quantity
  - `Oid` must match format

### 🔹 `ITEM`
- Fields: `Iid`, name, description, price, category (Veg/Non-Veg), type (starter, main course), cuisine, rating, guilt-free status, Jain food status
- Constraints:
  - Valid categories
  - Ratings between 1 and 5
  - Positive price

### 🔹 `MENU`
- Maps items to restaurants
- Fields: `Rid`, `Iid`, availability time
- Constraints:
  - Valid foreign key references to `ITEM` and `RESTAURANT`

### 🔹 `PAYMENT`
- Fields: `Pid`, `Oid`, `status`, `type` (cash, card, online)
- Constraints:
  - Valid statuses (success, pending)
  - Only allowed payment types

### 🔹 `MEMBERSHIP`
- Fields: `Mid`, `Cid`, type (Gold/Silver/Platinum), start date, end date, active status
- Constraints:
  - Logical date ranges
  - Valid membership types
